Machine learning 


In this repository I will work on the machine learning for the mechanical engineering and applications related to the biomedical field,
like right now I'm working on the AAA (Abdominal Aorta Aneuryms) model using PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Network) where, 
I'm comparing the results and optimising the performance of the simulation, mesh creation, and cutting the cost for the application uses,
and this model is patient-specific, so it will generate each patient data and helpful in the surgery.

thank you
